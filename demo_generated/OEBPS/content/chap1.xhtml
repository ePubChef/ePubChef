            he ePubChef code will be fully owned by the author and act as a wrapper around the book text. This enables the author to retain full control of his or her work. A valid set of EPUB files can be produced as often as desired during the life of the book from first outline to completed work. The ePubChef can run on Windows, Mac, or Linux. While book generation is automated, there is also the capability for creative formatting of the book and even automated personalization of each copy.

            With the ePubChef ugly, poorly formatted electronic publications should become a thing of the past. Authors will not be dependent on technical experts to publish. EBook creation experts can concentrate on adding value through style and formatting without monotonous, error prone copying and pasting.
