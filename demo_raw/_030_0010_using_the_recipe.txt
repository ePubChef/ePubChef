An ePubChef "recipe" file is the control file for generation of an eBook. Open /demo_raw/demo_recipe.yaml for an example. Entries in the front and back matter sections can be moved, added to, or removed. If you create a new entry, you must also create a template file with the same name. It is usually best to copy an existing, similar template and alter it.

Entries under sections "parts" and "chapters" can be added or changed. Alter the appropriate change in the template to match.
