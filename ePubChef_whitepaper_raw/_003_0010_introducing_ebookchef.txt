The ePubChef project takes a new approach to the challenge of creating EPUB books. Its aims are simple:
<ul>
  <li>no lock-in to proprietary formats</li>
  <li>future proof</li>
  <li>automate the production of high quality eBooks - without dumbing down </li>
  <li>extendible for experts to craft individual formats and layouts</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is it like to use ePubChef?</h3>
The hardest part of using ePubChef to write a book is still writing the book. Ninety-nine percent of the time the author will utilize a text editor to write. The ePuChef does not change that. 

In addition to the text of a book the author also creates a "recipe" for the ePubChef to follow. An example recipe can be seen in chapter six. The recipe contains meta-data about your book and gives the Chef instructions to create the book. It includes chapter names and a code for each chapter which is to be used in the text file names.

To generate the EPUB an author or publisher executes the ePubChef code from his or her computer's command line. Thus the many files of an EPUB are created. The author can then use a standard EPUB validation tool to check the results.

<h4>Mark-up</h4>
For a work of fiction, most of the mark-up in a book is in the beginning of each chapter and the front and back matter pages. EPubChef takes care of this mark-up through the use of templates. Changing the chapter template, for example will alter the appearance of all chapters without requiring alteration of each individual chapter.

Within the text of a chapter, one may wish to have block-quotes, italics or other mark-up. Block quotes can be created by putting ">>>" at the start of a paragraph. Italics can be done using underscores (__text__) or HTML tags &lt;em>important words&lt;/em>. Any HTML snippets can be used in the text. Paragraph tags will be added automatically. Authors should not fear snippets of HTML mark-up as it is future proof and not tied to a particular version of word processing software.

<h3>Changing Book Layout</h3>
This white paper has chapter numbers, chapter titles, an image, and a some text in italics at the beginning of each chapter. This is produced from (1) the chapter template, and (2) the recipe entry for each chapter.

The important part of the chapter template is:
<p><img class="displayed" src="../images/chapter_code.jpg" height="100" alt="chapter code" /></p>

The template uses double squiggly brackets to insert variable values or text. The chapter "nbr" is provided by the ePubChef code. The "name" and "photo" values are taken from the recipe.

The relevant section from the recipe for this chapter is:
<p><img class="displayed" src="../images/recipe_chapter.jpg" height="100" alt="recipe chapter" /></p>

To alter the look of book chapters, simply change the template and recipe. For example, one could remove the chef's hat photo and instead add a quotation by removing the "photo" from the recipe and adding a new field "quotation" then altering the template to match.

The table of contents is generated automatically, but the appearance is configurable. One can reorder front and back matter pages very easily.

Each chapter can begin with a drop capital by altering a setting in the recipe.

<h3>EPUB Variants</h3>
The ePubChef can use a different CSS stylesheet on books destined for Kindle if desired. All CSS is under the author's control although defaults are provided. The ePubChef can exclude the cover from Kindle and will re-number the internal page counter.

The ePubChef contains templates for the EPUB 2 standard but is extendible to EPUB 3 or related formats.
